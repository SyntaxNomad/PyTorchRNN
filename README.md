# IMDB Sentiment Analysis - RNN in PyTorch

This is a sentiment analysis project trained on IMDB movie reviews. It uses a word-level RNN built with PyTorch to classify each review as either positive or negative.

Originally, I built an RNN from scratch using NumPy to get a deeper understanding of how things work under the hood. That version reached about 51% accuracy - barely better than random guessing. After switching to PyTorch and implementing an LSTM-based architecture, I hit around 84.7% accuracy.

This was part of my learning journey in NLP and PyTorch â€” and it gave me a much stronger grasp of embeddings, LSTMs, and training pipelines.

## Highlights
- Word-level tokenization and vocabulary limited to top 5000 words
- Embedding layer + LSTM built with PyTorch
- Binary classification using BCEWithLogitsLoss
- Optimized using Adam
- Clean, padded input sequences and manual batching
